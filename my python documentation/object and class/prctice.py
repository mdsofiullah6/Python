# In the class -based object - oriented programming paradigm , 'object' refers to a particular instance of a class  where
# the object can be a combination of variables , functions, and data structures .
#Objects are key to understading object -oriented technology . Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real - world objects :
# your dog,your desk,your television set, your bicycle .
# Real world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior .
# Dogs have state (name,color,breed,houngry)and behavior (braking, fetching , wagging tail).
#Bicycles also have state(current gear,current pedal cadecne, current speed).
# and behavior for real - world bojects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming .
#In the image below , we see an example of the relationshiop between an object and class .
# An object is derived from a class . An boject is created from a class . You can think of class as a blueprint and
# an object created fromthat blueprint .
